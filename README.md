# FSP Duncan

http://duncanfsp.pythonanywhere.com/

A CRUD web application using Flask, MySQL that fuses a job board for students, a point system for completed jobs, and job forms for student availability to manage 100+ students for a residential college at Rice.

Admin users input jobs, students fill out forms to sign up for jobs, students are algorithmically assigned and notified which jobs are assigned to them, superusers give/take points to students if they complete the job.
